# Java Learning Repository ðŸ“š

This repository contains beginner-friendly Java examples and notes created during my first year of studying software engineering. Each folder includes small programs that demonstrate key concepts such as:

- Variables and data types
- User input with Scanner
- Conditional logic (if / switch)
- Loops (for / while)
- Console output

All code is written independently to reinforce my understanding and avoid academic plagiarism. This project helps me track my progress and build a foundation for future backend and cloud development.
